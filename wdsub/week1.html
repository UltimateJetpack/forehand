<!--
  Hi Jaxon, good first webpage submission! The only thing you're missing is that your DOCTYPE tag needs a "!" directly before the tagname.
  Since that tag is misformatted, it causes the browser to misinterpret the head tag. take a look at your webpage and use the Inspect tool to see how the browser interprets it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Week 1 Submission</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--I wish I were sigma like Tristan-->
    <p>Tristan is really sigma</p>
    <!--<p>Tristan is very strong</p>-->
    <h1>Week 1 Submission</h1>
    <h2>html</h2>
    <p>this tells the browser that the content is in html</p>
    <h2>head</h2>
    <p>this is a container for information not displayed on the page</p>
    <h3>title</h3>
    <p>This always lives in the head. It is necessary for a valid html5 page</p>
    <h2>body</h2>
    <p>This contains all the content that will appear on a webpage</p>
  </body>
</html>
