  <h2 class="heading">"Animal Farm"</h2>
  <p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm" target="_blank">Animal Farm</a>" is a modern fable, a parable, a story to teach a lesson. And the lesson is about more than Russian Communists. It's a lesson about how power corrupts, no matter the situation. In the novel, the animals on Manor Farm revolt against Farmer Jones and win possession and control of the farm.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass"</h2>
  <p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Frederick_Douglass">The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.</a>” is a good book, touching story. It's for sure one of the best novels I've ever read. It's emotionally engaging and keeps you interested, nvm the fact that it tells the heartbreaking story of what Frederick and so many other real people actually had to go through. 10/10 would recommend.</p>
